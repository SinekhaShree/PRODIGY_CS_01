## Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption in Python
This Python script implements the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique, for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## Features:
1)Encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
2)User-friendly interface for choosing encryption/decryption and entering messages and shift values.
3)Input validation to ensure valid integer input for the shift value.
4)Generates visualizations of character frequencies in original and encrypted text using Plotly (requires separate installation).
5)Getting Started:

## 1)Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/caesar-cipher.git

## 2)Install required libraries (if not already installed):
pip install plotly

## 3)Run the script:
python caesar_cipher.py

## How it Works:

The script provides a menu-driven interface where you can choose to encrypt or decrypt a message. It prompts you for the message and a shift value (integer representing the number of positions to shift letters in the alphabet). The script then performs the encryption/decryption and displays the result.

## Optional: Visualizing Character Frequencies:

The script includes functionality to generate bar charts showing the frequency of each letter in the original and encrypted text using Plotly. These visualizations can help understand how the encryption process affects letter distribution.

## Disclaimer:

Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique and is not considered secure for real-world applications. It's intended for educational purposes and demonstrating basic cryptographic concepts.
